  <h3>Lifetime Heats Calculator</h3>
  <p>Every wolf, regardless of sex, has a heat cycle! It doesn't show on male wolves, but it coorelates to their age. Depending on their age, a male wolf might go immediately into heat when they're sex changed. This calculator will tell you if your male wolf would be in heat if you were to sex change them, or how far away their heat would be!<br>Using an aging crystal on a pup or adolescent messes with this heat cycle. Aging crystal functionality coming soon!<br></p>
